# SQL Developer Internship - Task 2

**Data Insertion and Handling Nulls**

## üìå Task Overview
Practice inserting, updating, and deleting data while handling NULL values in SQL.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- DB Fiddle (or SQLiteStudio)
- SQL (SQLite flavor)

## üìÇ Repository Structure
```
[Insert the folder structure shown above]
```

## üöÄ How to Run
1. **Using DB Fiddle**:
   - Go to [db-fiddle.com](https://www.db-fiddle.com/)
   - Paste contents of `scripts/setup.sql` to create tables
   - Run `inserts.sql`, then `updates.sql`, then `deletes.sql`

2. **Using SQLiteStudio**:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 task2.db
   .read scripts/setup.sql
   .read scripts/inserts.sql
   ```

## üìù Key Features Demonstrated
- Proper NULL handling with `IS NULL`, `COALESCE`
- Complex INSERT with multiple rows
- Conditional UPDATE statements
- Transaction-safe DELETE operations
